# Captain Hook

Captain Hook is a tool for sending notifications based on webhooks. You connect an application with it, maps how the webhooks will produce the notifications and Captain Hook will deliver a notification when a webhook arrives.

## How To Build

This is a 100% Java application so you can just do the idiomatic `mvn package`.

## How It Works

Captain Hook allows three different ways of delivering a notification:

- by taking a webhook and producing events that can be subscribed for delivering notifications
- by taking an event and deliver notifications to its subscribers
- by taking the notification as is

When a webhook is captured, it will be analyzed in order to make an event from it. Usually we can't change a webhook's payload so any query parameter sent will be converted to a label. So if the crew receives a webhook with `foo=bar` in the url, the webhook will have a label `foo` with a value `bar`. This will help the crew to differentiate boarded webhooks to produce the events.

Events are a simple structure composed by:

- `name`: what differentiates this event from other events
- `labels` (optional): a set of labels that can be used for filtering if you need to be more specific than just a type
- `title` (optional): the title of this event, it will be used for notification purposes
- `message`: the message that describes this event, used for notifications
- `url` (optional): a url that contains more information about this event, used for notifications as well

A Notification is the result of attaching an Event, to an Address. It contains:

- `title` (optional): the title of this event, it will be used for notification purposes
- `message`: the message that describes this event, used for notifications
- `url` (optional): a url that contains more information about this event, used for notifications as well
- `destination`: contains the address that should receive the notification
- `priority`: the priority of this notification (`low (-1)`, `normal (0)` or `high (+1)`)
- `labels` (optional): a set of labels that adds more context to the notification

Addresses are composed by a channel name and a target destination. On top of that, Transmitters are responsible for reaching the address to deliver the notification.

For example, the address `my_chat:some-user` will be reached by a Transmitter responsible for the channel `my_chat` that will pass the notification to the target `some-user`. This is totally dependent on the channel type as each platform has its own way of identifying targets (user, chat room, broadcast channel, etc.).

## How To Configure

Captain Hook expects a yaml file containing:

- transmitters
- event subscriptions
- webhook mappings

The file can be passed by either:

- `-Dconfig.file=/path/to/file` JVM parameter
- `CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/file` environment variable

### Sensitive Parameters

Every sensitive configuration, such as passwords and tokens, can be provided through four ways:

- Specifying the value in the configuration file
```
token: token_in_plain_text
# using a key is also a valid way
token:
  value: token_in_plain_text
```
- Specifying an environment variable that contains the value
```
token:
  env: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE
```
- Specifying a JVM property that contains the value
```
token:
  property: some.property
```
- Specifying a file that holds the value
```
token:
  file: /path/to/file
```

Why specifying a file? In a Kubernetes/OpenShift environment you might want to use a Secret in order to store sensitive values since Secrets are mounted in a RAM-backed filesystem so the contents are always volatile.

### Templates

Every configuration that accepts a template can be set by either passing the template as is or passing the file that should be loaded. The relative directory is configured by the property `templates.dir` which can be set by either:

- `-Dtemplates.dir=/path/to/the/directory` JVM parameter
- `TEMPLATES_DIR=/path/to/the/directory` environment variable

### Selectors

Selectors allow you to filter webhooks and events based on a set of labels attached to them. Currently a selector can be created by supplying the labels you need to filter and the value that should be or not present:

- To specify the value, pass it as is
```foo: bar```
- To specify the label should hold a value, pass a `*`
```foo: *```
- To specify the label should not hold a value, pass a `!`
```foo: !```
- To specify multiple allowed values for a label, separate them with a `|`
```foo: bar|baz```

### Transmitters

#### Transmitter Type

Back to the common Transmitter configuration, every configuration must include the key `type` so the Captain can pass the right command to the crew. You can have as much as Transmitters you need as long as they have different names.

#### Telegram

Telegram Bots are a nice way to deliver notifications, you can create a bot and have a token in less than one minute. All you need is `telegram` as `type`, a sensitive input as `token` and, optionally, a Freemarker template for how to structure the message.

```yaml
transmitters:
  my_telegram_bot:
    type: telegram
    token: 999999999:01234567890ABCDEFGHIJ-KLMN
    template: |
      ${(title)!}
      ${message}
      ${(url)!}
```

All notification attributes can be used as variables.
 
#### Pushover

Pushover is a notification service available for almost every platform. All you need is `pushover` as `type` and a sensitive input as `token`.

```yaml
transmitters:
  pushover:
    # remember: type is required, even if it is the same name as the transmitter
    type: pushover
    token:
      value: lanrbhgjaiou4872yuijuqy68f7uhiadyg78u3
```

#### HTTP

You can also uses a generic http call to forward the notification. Remember, Captain Hook only cares about delivering notifications, integration between systems is not the focus on this ship.

In case you wanna use the HTTP Transmitter, let Captain know, besides `http` as `type`:

- `url`: the actual url that will receive the notification
- `headers`: the map containing any additional headers
- `payload`: the payload definition that will be sent

```yaml
transmitters:
  my_awesome_receiver:
    type: http
    url: https://my.endpoint.integration/${target}
    headers:
      from: captain-hook
    payload:
      message: ${message}
```

Notice that any value can be evaluated as a template, even the headers. The payload will be sent as JSON.

This transmitter is good if you need to separate the notification at the endpoint. You could easily create one for Telegram, Pushover, Slack of any of those platforms that offers a web api.

```yaml
transmitters:
  telegram:
    type: http
    url: https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE/sendMessage
    payload:
      chat_id: ${target}
      text: ${message}
  pushover:
    type: http
    url: https://api.pushover.net/1/messages.json
    payload:
      token: YOUR_TOKEN
      user: ${target}
      message: ${message}
      title: ${title}
```

#### Router

In case you just need to route a notification to an endpoint, you can use a `router` Transmitter. This transmitter will use full url's as targets and the same configuration options as the HTTP transmitter for each route:

```yaml
transmitters:
  to:
    type: router
    routes:
      requestbin:
        url: https://YOUR_REQUEST_BIN_ID.x.pipedream.net
        payload:
          notification:
            message: ${message}
            title: ${title}
            url: ${url}
      telegram:
        url: https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_BOT_TOKEN/sendMessage
        payload:
          # sends every notification to this chat id (private or group)
          chat_id: YOUR_CHAT_ID
          text: ${message}
```

In this example, you could only refer to the address `to:requestbin` and the notification will be sent to your RequestBin endpoint. Following the same logic, using the address `to:telegram` will send notifications to the specified Telegram chat.

#### Virtual

Virtual addresses can be used to shorten an address or to group multiple ones. If you often type `my_chat:my-user` you can short it to something like `me` and map it to that address.

The Virtual Address transmitter allows you to create virtual addresses, just use the `type` as `virtual` and pass the mappings as the `addresses`:

```yaml
transmitters:
  virtual:
    type: virtual
    addresses:
      # the key can have the same name as a transmitter
      pushover: pushover:my-long-pushover-key
      my_telegram: telegram:99999999
      # you can have more than one address pointing to the same virtual address
      test:
      - virtual:pushover
      - virtual:my_telegram
```

#### Creating a Default Transmitter

If you create a transmitter named `default`, it will be used to handle addresses without specifying the channel. So when you subscribe the address `my_team` it will be converted to `default:my_team` and the `default` transmitter will be used.

A good tip is to define a `virtual` transmitter as the default one so you can use virtual addresses by default and keep your configuration clean.

### Subscriptions

To configure subscriptions, you need to inform the event type, the labels that should be present on the event and the destination to send the notification. Only the destination is required.

```yaml
subscriptions:
  # any event of name test will be sent to the virtual address test
- name: test
  destination: test
  # any event with the label from=nexus will be sent to the telegram:devs address
- selector:
    from: nexus
  destination: telegram:devs
  # any event will be sent to the dump virtual address
- destination: dump
```

### Webhook Mappings

To configure the webhooks, you need to inform how the payload will be converted into an event. This is the structure of a webhook mapping:

```yaml
webhooks:
- selector:
    # the url should contain from=test as a query string
    # or the header "from" should contain the value "test"
    from: test
  event:
    labels:
      # the /bar payload attribute will be used as the label value
      foo: ${foo}
      # nested attributes are also allowed, everything from Freemarker can be used here
      # just try to stick with short values for labels
      category: ${data.info.category}
    # name and message are required attributes
    name: test
    message: Test event from ${person.contact.phone}
```

The `selector` will be used to check if the webhook should be processed by this mapping. The `event` is the structure of the event that will be produced. Note that if you don't define a selector, every webhook will be processed by the same mapping.

#### Webhook Examples

Bellow are some examples of how to use Captain Hook with known tools to leverage their notification capabilities.

##### Gitlab

```yaml
webhooks:
- selector:
    # GitLab sends this header so we can grab it on the selector
    X-Gitlab-Event: Push Hook
  event:
    # use anything for labels that makes easy to make good filtering
    labels:
      source: gitlab
      type: push
      project: ${project.name}
      ref: ${ref}
      user: ${user_username}
    name: gitlab.push
    title: New push - ${project.name}
    url: ${project.web_url}
    message: |
      ${total_commits_count} commits pushed by ${user_name}
```

This example will raise an event every time a GitLab push hook is received. Since the labels provide information about the project, branch and user, we could have subscriptions for those specific labels as well:

```yaml
- selector:
    source: gitlab
  # virtual address
  destination: pushover_gitlab
- selector:
    source: gitlab
    type: push
    project: captain_hook
    ref: refs/heads/master
  # virtual address
  destination: captain_hook_team
```

With this example, every event from gitlab will notify the `pushover_gitlab` address but, if the event is also for a push on the `master` branch of the `captain_hook` project, the event will also notify the `captain_hook_team` virtual address.
